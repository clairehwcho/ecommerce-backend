# E-Commerce Back End

<!-- omit in toc -->
## Description

This is the back end application for an e-commerce website using Express, MySQL, Sequelize and dotenv. By creating an environment variable file with database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password, user can connect to a database using Sequelize. When the application is invoked, the server is started and the Sequelize models for categories, products, and tags are synced to the MySQL database. User can create, read, update, and delete data in the database by testing API POST, GET, PUT, DELETE routes in Insomnia.
